                        The objective of this project involves migrating the existing screens from Oracle forms to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) due to the discontinuation of support for Oracle forms by Microsoft. The screens being migrated are integral to the management of the Global Terminal System (GTS) warehouse. The GTS warehouse management application is specifically designed to oversee the warehousing operations of IKEA. By transitioning to WPF, we aim to modernize and enhance the user interface and overall functionality of the warehouse management system, ensuring a seamless and efficient warehouse management experience for IKEA and its stakeholders.

                        The primary objective of this project is to develop an online licensing system. The system will encompass two distinct types of licensing systems: entitlement and licensing. It will facilitate the issuance of licenses for various operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Furthermore, the system will also extend entitlements for third-party software applications such as VMWare and McAfee. By implementing this comprehensive licensing system, users will be able to seamlessly manage and obtain licenses for a wide range of software products, enhancing their overall experience and ensuring compliance with licensing regulations.

                        The Capacity Planning Process (CPP) is an application utilized to facilitate the end-to-end Capacity Planning Process for all 1:1 deal, effectively capturing deal solutions for the BPO Organization. In line with the BPO delivery business model, a proposal for CPP-DCSO – BPO – 1 to Many Releases has been put forth to align the Capacity Planning Process (CPP) Tool. BPO has undergone a revision of its business model and modified how the organization aims to package deals for clients. Starting from FY10, the CPP tool was specifically designed to support the "1:1" business model, where one deal corresponds to one BPO client. However, beginning FY11, BPO's objective is to allocate 50% of its business towards operating under a "1: M" model, enabling the re-utilization of one deal by multiple clients.
